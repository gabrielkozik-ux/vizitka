                <p>On Thursday, November 6, 2025, the Tišnov networking club <strong>Business for Breakfast</strong> met for its regular breakfast, this time in an extraordinary setting. We were hosted by the newly reopened <a href="https://www.laskalacafe.cz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laskala Café</a> in Tišnov, which we immediately fell in love with.</p>
                <p>The atmosphere was incredibly friendly and inspiring right from the morning. The café owner, Jitka Jirků, and her team prepared an absolutely wonderful meal for us, which only enhanced the overall impression. The coffee was aromatic, discussions flowed, and new, interesting connections were made between members and <strong>7 new guests</strong>, sparking endless inspiration.</p>

                <h2>Not Just Breakfast, But Also Visions for the Future</h2>
                <p>But this meeting wasn't just about morning networking. After the official part, we met with the club members for a "business meeting" to discuss the further development and direction of our Tišnov group. One of the central topics was the preparation for a <strong>grand New Year's networking party</strong>.</p>

                <blockquote>Our main plan now is to organize the New Year's party on January 8, 2026, and to connect not only local entrepreneurs but also representatives from the city of Tišnov and the neighboring town of Kuřim. We want to create a strong B2B community throughout the entire region.</blockquote>

                <h2>Connecting with MAS and Regional Development</h2>
                <p>An important part of the planned event will also be to present the opportunities that <a href="https://www.masbranavysociny.cz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MAS Brána Vysočiny</a> offers to entrepreneurs. We want to show what specific grant and support programs companies can use for their growth. Our goal is to actively involve entrepreneurs from Kuřim as well, creating a strong B2B community project that extends beyond the borders of a single town.</p>
                <p>The November meeting at Laskala wasn't just another event in the series; it was a real restart with new energy and clear plans. Thank you to Jitka Jirků for the wonderful hospitality and to all guests and members for an inspiring morning!</p>
