                <p>Yesterday evening was proof that when exceptional people come together, great things happen. Our first B2B event, titled <strong>Corporate Culture: An Evening with Alveno</strong>, exceeded all expectations, and we are still processing our impressions.</p>
                <p>During two panel discussions, four workshops, and round-table debates, we delved into the key topics of our time. However, the greatest value for us was the people themselves.</p>
                
                <blockquote>In the premises of IRESOFT s.r.o. and Alveno, thirty ambitious and inspiring personalities gathered, united by one fundamental thing: a sincere desire to create, help, support, and actively change the world for the better.</blockquote>

                <p>The evening clearly showed that these values know no generational boundaries, which was perfectly confirmed by the final discussion with young men Jakub Pavlas and Karel Bednář (led by Táňa Strojná). We are proud to have been able to connect so many great people in one place.</p>

                <h2>Thanks to Partners and Guests</h2>
                <p>A huge thank you to all the guests, speakers, and partners for the unforgettable atmosphere. We thank <strong>Michal Hochman</strong> and <strong>Renáta Balíková</strong> for the infusion of valuable advice and shared experiences.</p>
                <p>And thanks also go to <strong>Pavel Šumpík</strong> and the entire Alveno company for the wonderful facilities and co-organization. It was an evening full of inspiration that energizes us to continue what we do. And last but not least, we thank <strong>Jirka Urban</strong> for the great photos and reports.</p>
