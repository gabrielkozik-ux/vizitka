                <p>On Friday, July 18, the very first workshop focused on the practical use of Google's AI tools took place in my Brno office. An absolutely fantastic group of entrepreneurs and freelancers gathered, and the atmosphere was charged with curiosity and a desire to explore from the very beginning. The goal was to demystify artificial intelligence and show how it can save us time, money, and stress in real life.</p>

                <h2>What Did We Learn?</h2>
                <p>We went through the absolute basics and highlighted the biggest differences between the various tools. The main idea was to understand that AI is not magic, but a powerful assistant that you need to learn to communicate with.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What AI Is and Isn't:</strong> We explained the difference between AI as a creative assistant and a standard search engine. We discussed why AI sometimes "hallucinates" and how important it is to verify facts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gemini in Practice:</strong> We tried out how to use Gemini to create social media content, write an email, or analyze a simple text.</li>
                    <li><strong>NotebookLM as a Knowledge Base:</strong> We demonstrated how to create your own private database from documents, contracts, or podcasts that will give you precise answers without making things up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> We also mentioned the risks and showed why you should never input sensitive company data into public versions of AI tools.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="video-container">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e1234567890" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                <blockquote>What made me happiest was when participants realized that AI isn't just for "IT guys." Seeing them prepare a post in a few minutes that would otherwise take an hour was priceless.</blockquote>

                <h2>What's Next?</h2>
                <p>The huge interest and positive feedback have convinced me that this workshop series is worthwhile. The first one was a success, and I'm already preparing the next one.</p>
                <p><strong>Missed it? The next date is already set for August 22, 2025.</strong> If you want to find out how AI can make your life easier, don't miss it.</p>
