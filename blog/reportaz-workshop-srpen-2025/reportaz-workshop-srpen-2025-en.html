                <p>On Friday, August 22, the workshop focused on the practical use of Google's AI tools took place in our Brno office. A great group of people came together, and the atmosphere was absolutely fantastic. The goal was simple – to bust myths and show how artificial intelligence can genuinely save us hours of work and open up new creative possibilities.</p>

                <h2>From Theory to Practice in One Morning</h2>
                <p>We started with the most important thing: we explained that <strong>AI is not an all-knowing Google</strong> but rather a creative assistant whose outputs need to be verified. We discussed the risks of "hallucinations" and showed why a well-formulated query (prompt) is the foundation of everything.</p>

                <p>Then we dove into practice. Participants got to try out how to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use <strong>Gemini</strong> as a universal AI tool to create content, code simple pages, perform in-depth analyses, and communicate with other Google services.</li>
                    <li>Create their own knowledge base in <strong>NotebookLM</strong> that draws only from uploaded documents (podcasts, books, contracts) and answers without the risk of making things up.</li>
                    <li>Connect AI with <strong>Google Workspace</strong> and have it summarize emails or schedule meetings directly in the calendar.</li>
                    <li>Compose an original song in a minute using <strong>Suno AI</strong>, which we thoroughly enjoyed.</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>What made me happiest was when participants had that "aha" moment, realizing how a specific tool could be immediately used in their business or personal life. Those moments are why I do this.</blockquote>

                <h2>What's Next?</h2>
                <p>The positive feedback has convinced me to continue with the workshop series. This second workshop was a continuation of a great start.</p>
                <p><strong>Missed it? No problem! The next date is already set for September 19, 2025.</strong> If you want to take your efficiency to the next level and learn to master tools that will give you an edge, don't miss it.</p>
