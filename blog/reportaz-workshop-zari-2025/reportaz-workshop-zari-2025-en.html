                <p>On Friday, September 19, a great all-female group – Tereza, Kristýna, Martina, and Anna – gathered again to dive into the world of Google's AI tools. The goal was to build on the basics and explore more advanced techniques that push the boundaries of efficiency and creativity.</p>

                <h2>From Basics to Advanced Strategies</h2>
                <p>This time, we built on the fundamentals and went much deeper. The participants got to try out how to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Explore <strong>advanced prompting techniques in Gemini</strong> to get more accurate and creative results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create and immediately host simple web pages</strong> with the help of AI, opening the door to rapid idea prototyping.</li>
                    <li>Analyze <strong>NotebookLM</strong> in detail and its power for building a private, citable knowledge base. No more "hallucinations," only verified facts from your own sources.</li>
                    <li>Introduce <strong>Google AI Studio</strong> as a new tool and its possibilities for working with data in real-time, for example, for live stream analysis.</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>I see the biggest shift when participants stop seeing AI as a "smarter Google" and start using it as a thinking partner. The September group was absolutely fantastic in this regard.</blockquote>

                <h2>What's Next?</h2>
                <p>The great energy and targeted questions confirmed that we are on the right track, and I will continue with the workshop series.</p>
                <p><strong>Missed it? No problem! I am preparing the next date for October 2025.</strong> If you're interested, let me know so you don't miss out on a spot!</p>
