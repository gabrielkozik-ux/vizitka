            <p>Last week, on October 9th and 10th, Prague once again became the epicenter of the technological scene in Central Europe. The jubilee year of <strong>Innovation Week</strong> took place in the modern premises of the ČSOB Campus, and I was proud that our law firm, IUSTORIA, could be there as a partner of the event. It was an incredible storm of ideas, visions, and inspiring meetings.</p>

            <h2>Regulation That Is Not a Scarecrow, But an Opportunity</h2>
            <p>I had the honor of presenting a seminar on the topic <strong>"AI Act in Practice: What Every Czech Company Needs to Know"</strong>. The goal was to demystify the new European regulation on artificial intelligence and show that it is not a bureaucratic brake, but a well-thought-out framework for safe and trustworthy innovation. We went through key points that resonated with the audience of entrepreneurs and managers:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A Risk-Based Approach:</strong> We explained that the AI Act does not burden all companies equally. The greatest obligations fall on high-risk systems, while for most common AI tools (such as chatbots or content generators), transparency is the key.</li>
                <li><strong>Practical Impacts:</strong> Using examples, we showed what the obligation to inform users that they are interacting with AI means, or how to correctly label marketing content created by artificial intelligence.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsibility and Data:</strong> We emphasized that the responsibility for using AI always lies with the company that deployed it. This places a huge emphasis on selecting vetted suppliers and protecting sensitive data in accordance with GDPR.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Energy That Drives the Future</h2>
            <p>The entire event was charged with positive energy. The pulse of innovation could be felt from every corner of the campus – people were meeting, sharing ideas, and arranging new collaborations. Innovation Week once again confirmed why it is a key event for anyone who wants not only to follow trends but to actively shape the future of Czech business.</p>
            <p>Thank you to the organizers for a great job and to everyone who stopped by my seminar. I am already looking forward to next year and to seeing how the ideas from this year's meeting will turn into real projects.</p>
